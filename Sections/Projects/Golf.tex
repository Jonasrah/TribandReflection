\subsection{Golf All the Things}
Golf All the Things is a game currently under development. When my internship started a number of levels had already been made and were being tested. The concept is that regular golf is boring, so a variety of wacky elements is incorporated in the game. In one level, instead of shooting the golf ball across the field, the player propels the golf player himself towards the hole. In another level, the player plays as an elephant being kidnapped by some evil-doers. The general mechanic is that the player touches a point on the screen, moves the finger in a desired direction and lifts the finger. The line between the initial point and the point of release defines the amount of force and direction is applied in the game.
