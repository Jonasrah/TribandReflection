\subsection{Torsten Spis P{{\ae}}nt}
Torsten Spis P{\ae}nt is an original cartoon series in active development. It is about a young boy who is living with his mom in {\O}restaden, Copenhagen and his exploration of new and exciting food. In the pilot episode, Torsten's mom cites the old phrase "you are what you eat," and the gullible Torsten takes this as fact, letting his imagination bring him into the world of animated fruits and vegetables. \newline
As part of the publishing deal for Torsten Spis P{\ae}nt a series of accompanying games is required. The series is in early development and has yet to be greenlit. For this to happen, content needs to be presented and accepted. Part of this content is prototypes for future games, and that is where Triband enters the partnership. Triband made a series of very rough prototypes to explore different game mechanics. The best two were selected and the actual development of two prototypes were tasked to me and the other intern at Triband. The work was divided with the other intern producing the art and animation, and me the programming and implementation. The mechanics of the two prototypes were previously decided on so the amount of design work were limited.
