\section{Introduction}
The following paper will report on my internship at Triband where I was working on the two projects Torsten Spis P{\ae}nt. I will describe the different prototypes and levels I made in correlation with these projects and go over what challenges I encountered and how I overcame them. Next, I will surmise my experiences and lastly reflect on how and why these experiences have aided me in becoming a better Game Designer.
