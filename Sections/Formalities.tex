\section{Formalities}
The internship were in collaboration with the small game studio, Triband. The internship ran from September to December 2017 and working hours were 20 per week. During the time of the internship Triband were developing two games and two prototypes. The two games were Keyboard Sports and Golf All the Things and the two prototypes were Madkamp and Torstens Mund. I was working on all of these except Keyboard Sports. None of the games or prototype have been released to the public. My role during the internship was Game Designer and in practice I worked on game mechanics, art, implementation, programming and level design. My contribution in the different projects has been considered valuable and will as of writing be apparent in any final release.
