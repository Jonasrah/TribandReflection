\subsection{Summary}
Working for Triband has allowed for a large variety of projects throughout my internship. The Torsten Spis P{\ae}nt project was a good insight in working on products that have an already set feature list, and how making games for a different target audience than I am used to can be. Working on Golf All the Things was an immense experience on how game studios actually make games. Clutter and tidying was a considerable factor when making a game of commercial scale, and for any future project of mine, I will, after this experience, put more weight on having good structure. Not because Golf All the Things was unstructured, but because Triband understood the importance of organization and I was able to experience the benefits of this. Another important experience was that making a level that you yourself can complete does not mean that the general player will be able to figure it out. Focusing on conveying meaning to the player can be the difference between the player enjoying the game or discarding it in frustration.
