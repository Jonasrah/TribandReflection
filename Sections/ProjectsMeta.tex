\section{Projects}
During my internship I worked on two prototypes and one game. The two prototypes were made in accordance to a partnership between Triband and Made in Copenhagen and were made to support a cartoon series for the Danish television network Danmarks Radio. The game is a game for mobile devices that is currently in development and planned for release in the first half of 2018 and with a consecutive PC release. The two next sections will cover the two projects and after this a summary will be given.
